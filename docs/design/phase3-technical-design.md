# Phase 3 Technical Design: ARP Worker, Controller, nftables-manager

Status: **design only, nothing in this document is built yet.** This is
the concrete follow-on to the architecture decision recorded in
[`RoadMap.md`](../../RoadMap.md) — that file has the "what and why," this
file has the "with which libraries and roughly what code." Nothing here
has been compiled or tested (this dev environment has no Go or Rust
toolchain installed), so treat every code sketch below as illustrative,
not verified.

---

## 1. Language decision: Go

`RoadMap.md` calls for "a memory-safe compiled language" for the
privileged ARP worker, without picking one. Recommendation: **Go**, for
three concrete reasons found while researching this:

1. **`mdlayher/arp`** is a small, purpose-built Go package implementing
   RFC 826 ARP directly — send/receive ARP requests and replies over a
   raw socket. This is exactly the worker's core job, already solved by
   a well-regarded low-level-networking Go author (mdlayher also
   maintains `mdlayher/ethernet`, `mdlayher/netlink`, `mdlayher/raw` —
   the whole stack this worker needs is one author's coherent
   ecosystem, not stitched-together miscellany).
2. **`knftables`** (`github.com/kubernetes-sigs/knftables`) is a
   Kubernetes SIG Network-maintained Go library, **Apache-2.0**,
   explicitly built so Kubernetes's own network components can drive
   nftables correctly — i.e. already trusted in production for exactly
   the kind of "a privileged daemon manages firewall state
   programmatically" job this project needs from its nftables-manager.
   It supports named sets and atomic transactions natively (an
   operation that would fail rolls back the whole transaction). By
   contrast, **`google/nftables`** (pure Go, no `nft` shell-out,
   Apache-2.0) explicitly documents itself as early-stage/experimental
   and "not recommended for production" with expected breaking changes
   — a worse fit despite the appeal of avoiding a subprocess. `knftables`
   shells out to the `nft` CLI internally, which is fine: the CLI is
   nftables' own most stable, well-documented interface, and this is a
   local subprocess call, not a network dependency.
3. Go's garbage-collected, bounds-checked memory model already satisfies
   "memory-safe" for a `CAP_NET_RAW`-only worker doing small, periodic
   packet sends — this isn't a workload where Rust's stronger
   compile-time ownership guarantees buy much, and Go gets there with a
   shallower learning curve and less code.

**Update 2026-08-29**: an initial Go scaffold implementing the design
below now exists in [`phase3/arp-worker/`](../../phase3/arp-worker/) —
the generation scheduler, corrective-restoration-on-switch logic, lease/
heartbeat state machine, safety checks, and IPC protocol from sections
3–4 below, each with unit tests. **Builds, vets, and passes its full
test suite on the smoke-test VM** (Go 1.26.7, `go build`/`go vet`/`go test -count=10`
all clean); see that directory's `README.md` for exact status. The
sketches below remain the reference design; the scaffold follows them
but sharpens one detail not spelled out here — a direct generation
switch only sends corrective ARPs to targets *leaving* scope, never to
targets present in both the old and new generation, to avoid a race
between a stale corrective pass and the new generation's own poisoning
ticks. One real API mismatch surfaced on first build:
`github.com/mdlayher/arp` uses `netip.Addr`, not `net.IP` — fixed in
`internal/arpio/mdlayher_adapter.go` with a conversion at that one
boundary.

Rust remains a legitimate alternative (`pnet` for packet crafting,
`netlink-packet-route`/`rtnetlink` crates for neighbor monitoring, both
actively maintained) if there's a reason to prefer it later, but nothing
found in this research makes Rust materially better-suited here, and
Go's library fit — especially `knftables` — is the deciding factor.

**Concrete package list, if Go is confirmed:**

| Concern | Package |
|---|---|
| ARP send/receive | `github.com/mdlayher/arp` |
| Ethernet framing | `github.com/mdlayher/ethernet` |
| Raw sockets | `github.com/mdlayher/raw` or `golang.org/x/net/bpf` |
| rtnetlink neighbor events | `github.com/vishvananda/netlink` (`NeighSubscribe`) or `github.com/jsimonetti/rtnetlink` |
| nftables (controller/nftables-manager side) | `github.com/kubernetes-sigs/knftables` |
| Unix socket IPC + peer-credential check | stdlib `net` (`net.UnixConn`) + `golang.org/x/sys/unix` (`SO_PEERCRED`) |
| systemd watchdog/notify | `github.com/coreos/go-systemd/v22/daemon` |

## 2. Licensing facts, verified for this document (updates/sharpens `RoadMap.md`)

- **bettercap**: confirmed `GPL-3.0` (its own `LICENSE.md`). Matches
  what's already in `RoadMap.md`.
- **Scapy**: confirmed `GPL-2.0-only` per its PyPI listing and license
  file — but worth knowing the project's own GitHub issues show some
  internal inconsistency/ambiguity about this (at least one contrib
  file under GPL-3.0 instead), which if anything is a reason for *more*
  caution, not less, about importing it as a library into a public
  repo's main process. Reinforces the existing decision to keep Scapy
  (if used at all, e.g. for a throwaway diagnostic script) out of the
  shipped worker entirely.
- **`knftables`**: `Apache-2.0` — no copyleft concerns at all, cleanest
  possible license for this specific piece.
- **`google/nftables`**: also `Apache-2.0`, but rejected above on
  maturity grounds, not licensing.
- **eBlocker**: `EUPL-1.2`, as already recorded in `RoadMap.md` — no new
  findings here, still "reference only."

## 3. ARP worker: packet-level design sketch

Core loop, one goroutine, operating on an immutable per-generation
target snapshot (per `RoadMap.md`'s "one scheduler, not a thread per
host" requirement):

```go
type Target struct {
    IP  net.IP
    MAC net.HardwareAddr // resolved once, refreshed on rebind
}

type Generation struct {
    ID       uint64
    Gateway  Target
    Targets  []Target // clients to poison
    FullDuplex bool
}

func (w *Worker) runGeneration(ctx context.Context, gen Generation) {
    ticker := time.NewTicker(w.interval)
    defer ticker.Stop()
    for {
        select {
        case <-ctx.Done():
            return // caller sends corrective ARPs on the way out
        case <-ticker.C:
            for _, t := range gen.Targets {
                w.sendGratuitousReply(t.IP, gen.Gateway.IP, w.selfMAC) // "gateway is at my MAC" -> client
                if gen.FullDuplex {
                    w.sendGratuitousReply(gen.Gateway.IP, t.IP, w.selfMAC) // "client is at my MAC" -> gateway
                }
                atomic.AddUint64(&w.sentCounter, 1)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`sendGratuitousReply` is a thin wrapper around `mdlayher/arp`'s
reply-construction: an ARP reply (opcode 2) with the spoofed
sender IP/MAC pair, sent to the target's real MAC over a raw socket
bound to the LAN interface.

**Corrective restoration** (the fail-open requirement from
`RoadMap.md`) is the same primitive with the *real* MAC addresses
substituted back in, sent several times with short spacing on the way
out:

```go
func (w *Worker) sendCorrective(gen Generation) {
    for i := 0; i < correctiveRepeats; i++ {
        for _, t := range gen.Targets {
            w.sendGratuitousReply(t.IP, gen.Gateway.IP, gen.Gateway.MAC) // real gateway MAC, not ours
        }
        time.Sleep(correctiveSpacing)
    }
}
```

**Startup safety checks**, before poisoning anyone:
- Resolve and validate the gateway's real MAC via a genuine ARP request
  (not from a possibly-already-poisoned cache).
- Reject as targets: the gateway itself, the worker's own interface
  IP/MAC, the subnet broadcast address, any multicast address, and
  every `bypass_v4` entry from the controller's target list.

## 4. Controller ↔ worker IPC: message schema (fleshes out the sketch in the engineering report)

Versioned JSON over a Unix domain socket, one connection, newline-delimited
frames. Peer credentials checked via `SO_PEERCRED` so only the controller
process (verified by UID, not just socket path) can drive the worker.

**Controller → worker:**
```json
{"v": 1, "op": "replace_targets", "generation": 43,
 "gateway": {"ip": "192.168.1.1", "mac": "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:01"},
 "targets": [
   {"ip": "192.168.1.21", "mac": "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:22"},
   {"ip": "192.168.1.35", "mac": "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:36"}
 ],
 "full_duplex": false}
```
```json
{"v": 1, "op": "heartbeat", "sequence": 8842}
```
```json
{"v": 1, "op": "shutdown", "reason": "controller_requested"}
```

**Worker → controller (replies + unsolicited events):**
```json
{"v": 1, "op": "generation_applied", "generation": 43, "target_count": 2, "resolution_failures": []}
```
```json
{"v": 1, "op": "heartbeat_ack", "sequence": 8842, "sent_counters": {"192.168.1.21": 118}}
```
```json
{"v": 1, "op": "fault", "reason": "lease_expired", "action": "entering_repair_only_mode"}
```

**Lease rule**: if the worker receives no `heartbeat` within
`N × interval` (N configurable, start conservative — e.g. 5 cycles), it
stops sending forged replies, sends one round of corrective ARPs for its
current generation, and enters a passive "repair-only" state, waiting for
a fresh `replace_targets` rather than resuming the stale one. This is the
concrete mechanism behind `RoadMap.md`'s "must not auto-resume an old
target generation after restart" requirement.

**Update 2026-08-29**: the controller side of this schema is now
implemented in [`controller/ipc_client.py`](../../controller/ipc_client.py)
(Python, per the architecture decision that the controller fits the
existing Python stack) — `WorkerClient.replace_targets`/`.heartbeat`/
`.shutdown()` speak exactly the JSON shape above. `controller/reconcile.py`
implements the idempotent-reconciliation half (generation only bumps
when desired state actually changes, order-insensitively on the target
list), and `controller/lease.py` drives the heartbeat on an interval.
Verified against real `AF_UNIX` sockets on the smoke-test VM — see
`RoadMap.md`'s Milestone 3 entry for status. `main.py`'s desired-state
source is still a placeholder pending Milestone 4.

## 5. nftables skeleton (four policy classes from `RoadMap.md`)

Illustrative `nft` syntax for what the nftables-manager (via `knftables`)
would maintain — a dedicated table, so nothing here interferes with any
other firewall rules on the box:

```
table inet parental_proxy {
    set authenticated_v4   { type ipv4_addr; flags interval; }
    set unauthenticated_v4 { type ipv4_addr; flags interval; }
    set bypass_v4          { type ipv4_addr; flags interval; }
    set quarantine_v4      { type ipv4_addr; flags interval; }

    chain prerouting {
        type nat hook prerouting priority dstnat; policy accept;

        ip saddr @bypass_v4 return

        ip saddr @authenticated_v4 udp dport 53  redirect to :5353   # -> AdGuard Home
        ip saddr @authenticated_v4 tcp dport 53  redirect to :5353
        ip saddr @authenticated_v4 tcp dport 80  redirect to :3129   # -> Squid, HTTP
        ip saddr @authenticated_v4 tcp dport 443 redirect to :3130   # -> Squid, HTTPS/bump

        ip saddr @unauthenticated_v4 udp dport 53 redirect to :5353  # still gets DNS
        ip saddr @unauthenticated_v4 tcp dport 80 redirect to :3131  # -> future portal
        # unauthenticated_v4 HTTPS: deliberately not redirected yet --
        # this is the "deliberate pre-auth policy" RoadMap.md flags as
        # still an open call for Phase 4, not decided here.

        ip saddr @quarantine_v4 counter drop
    }
}
```

Membership in these sets is exactly what `AUTH_CHANGED` events (from
`RoadMap.md`'s outbox-event design) update — the controller reconciles
`devices.is_authenticated` into set membership, `knftables` applies it
as one atomic transaction, and the worker's target list is **not**
affected by any of this (every enrolled device stays in the worker's
target list regardless of which set it's in — spoofing scope and policy
scope are different axes, per `RoadMap.md`).

---

## 6. systemd units (sketch)

```ini
# arp-worker.service
[Service]
Type=notify
WatchdogSec=15
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/pp-arp-worker
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_RAW
CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_NET_RAW
NoNewPrivileges=true
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=2
```

```ini
# interception-controller.service
[Service]
Type=notify
WatchdogSec=15
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/pp-interception-controller
User=pp-controller
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=2
```

`Type=notify` + `WatchdogSec` means the process must call `sd_notify`
with `WATCHDOG=1` on a schedule or systemd kills and restarts it — this
is the "watchdog notifications let systemd terminate a hung service"
mechanism `RoadMap.md`'s fail-open section calls for, not just
`Restart=on-failure` on its own (which only helps once a process has
actually exited, not when it's hung but still alive).

---

## 7. Database migration draft (for Milestone 4, not applied yet)

Following this project's own established migration discipline
(`common/db.py`'s `_migrate()`, real `ALTER TABLE`/`CREATE TABLE`
statements, idempotent):

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS device_bindings (
    id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    device_id     INTEGER REFERENCES devices(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    mac_address   TEXT NOT NULL,
    ipv4_address  TEXT NOT NULL,
    first_seen_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_seen_at  TEXT NOT NULL,
    source        TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'rtnetlink' | 'snapshot' | 'adguard' | 'bettercap' | 'active_scan'
    confidence    REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 1.0,
    active        INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    UNIQUE(mac_address, ipv4_address)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS interception_runtime (
    singleton_id       INTEGER PRIMARY KEY CHECK (singleton_id = 1),
    desired_generation INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    applied_generation INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    mode               TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'stopped', -- 'stopped'|'running'|'repair_only'|'fail_open'
    last_healthy_at    TEXT,
    fail_open_reason   TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS network_events (
    id           INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    event_type   TEXT NOT NULL,
    device_id    INTEGER REFERENCES devices(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    mac_address  TEXT,
    ipv4_address TEXT,
    source       TEXT NOT NULL,
    observed_at  TEXT NOT NULL,
    payload_json TEXT
);
```

Not wired into `common/db.py` yet — this is the reviewable draft for
when Milestone 4 (identity model) actually starts.

## 8. What this document does not decide

- Exact `unauthenticated_v4` HTTPS handling pre-login (flagged above as
  still open, belongs to Phase 4 design).
- Whether the controller and nftables-manager are one binary or two —
  sketched here as logically separate but could ship as one process
  with internally-separated privilege if that proves simpler; the
  worker must remain a separate process regardless, since it's the only
  piece holding `CAP_NET_RAW`.
- Final interval/threshold constants (spoof interval, lease cycle count,
  corrective repeat count/spacing) — these need real numbers from the
  soak-test milestone, not guessed up front.
