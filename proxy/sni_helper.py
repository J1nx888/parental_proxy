"""Squid `external_acl_type` helper for ssl_bump step2 decisions.

Invoked four different ways from squid.conf (same script, different mode
argument), each backing one ssl_bump rule, evaluated in this order:

    sni_helper.py trusted     -> OK if mode='trusted' (always spliced, unchecked)
    sni_helper.py bump        -> OK if mode='bump' (always fully decrypted)
    sni_helper.py splice      -> OK if mode='splice' AND this user may access it
    sni_helper.py block_page  -> catch-all for everything else (unrecognized
                                  domain, or a splice-mode domain this user
                                  can't access). OK if the admin's
                                  block_page_mode setting is 'redirect' --
                                  this deliberately bumps (decrypts) just
                                  this one connection so a real HTTP deny
                                  page can be served (via authz_helper.py's
                                  existing deny path) instead of a bare
                                  connection failure. If the setting is
                                  'terminate', always ERR here, so the
                                  connection falls through to squid.conf's
                                  final `ssl_bump splice step2 all` and is
                                  never decrypted at all -- the tradeoff is
                                  a broken-looking connection instead of an
                                  explanation.

Protocol (external_acl_type, format `%>a %ssl::>sni %DATA`): one line per
request, three percent-encoded fields, respond "OK" or "ERR". The trailing
%DATA field is always "-" (no `acl ... external ...` line below passes a
static argument) and is otherwise unused -- it must still be declared and
consumed, because Squid always appends %DATA to an external_acl_type FORMAT
that doesn't already include it (see squid.conf.template's comment).

Updated 2026-08-30 for Squid's intercept mode (RoadMap.md's "Squid:
explicit-proxy-with-login -> transparent intercept" section): %LOGIN is
gone -- an intercepted connection has no CONNECT handshake for Squid to
challenge with a 407, so there is no per-request login at all anymore.
Identity is now resolved from `%>a` (the client's source IP) via
common/device_identity.py's device_bindings-based lookup, the same
identity data the DNS tier already relies on.

'splice' mode logs every decision at this stage -- spliced connections are
never decrypted, so this is the only point that traffic is ever observed at
all. 'bump' mode and the 'block_page' bump-for-denial path both log richly
at the HTTP layer instead (authz_helper.py, once decrypted). 'block_page'
also logs a domain-only entry itself, but *only* for a genuinely
unconfigured domain when not in 'redirect' mode -- otherwise that case
would never be recorded anywhere, since nothing downstream ever runs to
log it either (GH #1). 'trusted' mode is deliberately never logged (see
project README).

    # from this layer was already logged for the same key -- see
