"""Phase 4 milestone 3: the captive-portal login server nftables has
been redirecting PREAUTH (unauthenticated_v4) devices' plain-HTTP
traffic to since Phase 3 was designed -- see
phase3/nftables-manager/internal/nft/knftables_adapter.go's
`baselineRules`, which already carries
`ip saddr @unauthenticated_v4 tcp dport 80 redirect to :3131` with a
`# -> future portal` comment in the original design doc. This module
is that future portal; the nftables/interception side needed NO
changes at all.

**Design decision, confirmed by how OS captive-portal detection
actually works (Apple/Google/Microsoft/Firefox all publicly documented
-- see RoadMap.md's dated entry for the exact expected values each OS
checks for) rather than assumed**: every one of these OSes probes a
plain-HTTP URL expecting an EXACT response (Apple:
`captive.apple.com/hotspot-detect.html` -> the literal string
"Success"; Android/Chrome: `.../generate_204` -> a bare 204; Windows:
`www.msftconnecttest.com/connecttest.txt` -> "Microsoft Connect Test";
Firefox: `detectportal.firefox.com/success.txt` -> "success"). Getting
ANYTHING else -- wrong status, wrong body -- is what every one of them
already treats as "there's a captive portal," and each then opens (or
offers to open) exactly the URL it just probed in a real browser/
webview, which -- since nftables redirects by source IP and
destination PORT, not by hostname -- lands right back on THIS server
and renders whatever HTML we send. That means a single handler that
always returns the same login page for every GET, regardless of path
or Host header, is enough to trigger every major OS's native "Sign in
to network" UI AND to show the login form for a device manually typing
a URL -- no per-OS special-casing needed.

**Self-resolving success path, not something this module has to
handle**: once a login succeeds and the device's `is_authenticated`
flag flips, it takes controller/main.py's own next reconcile cycle
(`--poll-interval`, default 5s) to actually move the device's IP from
`unauthenticated_v4` to `authenticated_v4` in the real kernel ruleset
(see controller/policy_state.py). From that point on, this device's
port-80 traffic is no longer redirected here at all -- the OS's own
routine re-probe of its detection URL reaches the REAL Apple/Google/
Microsoft server directly and gets the REAL expected response, which
is what makes the OS dismiss its own captive-portal UI on its own.
Nothing here needs to detect or announce that transition itself.

**No interception for HTTPS (tcp/443) -- a known, deliberate,
documented limitation, not an oversight**: matches virtually every
commercial captive portal (hotel/airport WiFi) in existence, and
`phase3/nftables-manager`'s baseline rules were never designed to
redirect 443 for unauthenticated_v4 either (there is no cert this
project's own CA can present that an ungated device already trusts,
same reasoning as `block_page_server.py`'s own explicit choice never to
terminate TLS for a domain a device hasn't been told to trust). In
practice this is what actually triggers detection for the overwhelming
majority of real usage anyway: the OS's own automatic captive-portal
probe fires immediately upon a new interception generation taking
effect, using plain HTTP specifically because every captive portal
implementation relies on that being interceptable. A technically
determined user who notices the redirect and deliberately avoids ever
completing an HTTP request could evade the prompt indefinitely; RoadMap.md
tracks this explicitly as a possible future hardening item (e.g.
dropping tcp/udp 443 for unauthenticated_v4 too) rather than something
silently added here without verifying it doesn't also break the OS's
own captive-portal-assistant webview, which sometimes needs its own
auxiliary HTTPS requests to render correctly.

**Portal-side admin action, added 2026-08-31**: the design sketch's
admin-facing quick-add path (RoadMap.md) originally offered two ways to
handle a gated device -- "the same portal screen, or a separate device
with real dashboard access." Only the latter existed until now
(Milestone 2's dashboard Bypass/Manage actions). This adds the former,
for when an admin is physically at the gated device itself: a
collapsed `<details>` section on the same login page, asking for the
SAME admin credentials `dashboard/dashboard.py`'s HTTP-Basic login
checks (`common/auth.py`'s `verify_admin_credentials()`, factored out
of `dashboard.py`'s own `_check_admin_auth` so there's exactly one
admin-credential check, not two), offering **Bypass** (identical effect
to the dashboard's own `/devices/bypass_login`) or **assign to a
group**. Shares this module's own per-IP rate limiter with the kid
login form above -- a wrong admin-password guess counts against the
same budget, which is the more conservative choice given this surface
grants strictly more than the kid login ever does.
