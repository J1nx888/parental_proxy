"""Milestone 6's remaining gap: block controller startup on its real
dependencies actually answering, not just on their containers having
started. docker-compose.yml's own comment on the controller service
already flags this precisely: "depends_on only waits for these
containers to *start*, not to be actually ready (arp-worker's socket
file, AdGuard's API)."

Two dependencies, two different failure philosophies, matching how the
rest of this codebase already treats each:

- The ARP worker's Unix socket is REQUIRED -- main.py's run() cannot do
  anything without it. wait_for_worker() below retries for a bounded
  time and then re-raises, same as an unbounded first attempt would
  have, so a genuinely-broken worker still surfaces as a process exit
  (and Docker's `restart: unless-stopped` still catches that, same
  fallback as before this module existed) -- it just turns the ordinary
  "arp-worker hasn't created its socket file yet" startup race into a
  fast in-process retry instead of a full container restart cycle.

- AdGuard is NOT required for the rest of run() to function --
  adguard_sync.py's own periodic run_loop() already retries forever on
  its own schedule and fails soft (logs via on_error, previous rules
  stay in effect). wait_for_adguard() below is a bounded, best-effort
  gate purely so main.py's sdnotify.ready() call means something closer
  to "confirmed reachable" when it can, without contradicting this
  project's own fail-open philosophy (RoadMap.md's "Fail-open
  engineering" section) by blocking startup indefinitely -- or crashing
  it -- over a slow-to-start AdGuard instance.
