    IPv4 addresses of every device currently classified into it, PLUS
    an independent `"bump"` entry (RoadMap.md's "two independent axes"
    section, locked 2026-08-30) for devices with bump_eligible() true.
    An IP can legitimately appear in both `"authenticated"` and
    `"bump"` at once -- bump is a refinement layered on top of
    authenticated access, not a fifth exclusive class, so it is
    computed independently rather than via classify_device().

    A device with more than one simultaneously-active binding (see
    common/identity.py's own notes on how that can briefly happen)
    contributes each of its active IPs -- unlike
    controller/desired_state.py's ARP-poisoning target list, there's no
    reason to pick only the freshest one here: every IP currently
    routed through this device's identity should get that device's
    policy. Devices with no active binding contribute nothing -- there's
    no IP to add to any set.

    **Phase 8 (2026-08-31)**: `now` (defaults to the current UTC instant;
    tests inject a fixed value) drives a second, independent overlay --
    a device whose classify_device() result ISN'T already BYPASS gets
    reclassified to QUARANTINE if `schedule_eval.is_full_lockout_active()`
    says a `lockout_all` schedule currently targets it. This is a PURE
    computation, same as bump_eligible() above -- it never writes
    `devices.quarantined_at`, so a manual operator quarantine (that
    column) and a scheduled bedtime lockout (this overlay) stay on fully
    independent axes: a device an admin manually quarantined stays
    quarantined regardless of any schedule, and a device under an active
    bedtime schedule returns to its normal classification the moment the
    window ends, with nothing left over to clean up. An already-BYPASS
    (`ignored`) device is never overridden -- "outside the whole system,
    for good" (common/db.py's own words on that column) includes being
    outside schedules too, matching the same baseline-protection rule
    already applied to AdGuard in controller/adguard_sync.py.
