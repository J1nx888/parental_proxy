"""Milestone 4/9 (ongoing): populates device_bindings from a periodic
`ip neigh show` snapshot -- the "periodic ip neigh snapshot (missed-
event reconciliation)" source from
docs/design/phase3-technical-design.md's discovery precedence order
(rtnetlink-first for lowest latency, this snapshot second as a
catch-all for anything missed).

This module implements ONLY the snapshot half of that precedence list
-- a live rtnetlink-event listener (the higher-precedence, lower-
latency source) is NOT built here; that needs real netlink socket
programming (e.g. via a package like pyroute2) that deserves its own
pass rather than being rushed alongside this. AdGuard query-log
correlation and active rate-limited ARP scanning (the remaining two
sources in that precedence list) also aren't built.

**Wired into a running loop as of 2026-08-30** via `run_loop()` below,
called from `controller/main.py` on its own background thread and its
own DB connection (see `run_loop`'s own docstring for why a separate
connection is required, not just a separate thread). This closes the
gap `docs/security/overview.md` §3 and RoadMap.md Milestone 4 both flag:
`device_bindings` freshness -- and therefore Squid's
`common/device_identity.py` identity resolution, and
`controller/policy_state.py`'s nftables policy computation -- depended
on *something* calling `snapshot_once()` regularly, and until now
nothing did. This does not replace the still-unbuilt live rtnetlink
listener (which would still improve staleness *within* this loop's own
interval); see the module docstring above.

    it in the shutdown path" shape.

    Deliberately does NOT accept a `conn` parameter -- it opens its OWN
    connection internally, lazily, the first time the background thread
    actually runs. This was a real bug in this function's first draft:
    `sqlite3.Connection` objects are only usable from the thread that
    *created* them (`check_same_thread=True`, `db.get_conn()`'s own
    default) -- and that's the thread that called `db.get_conn()`, not
    whichever thread later happens to execute queries on it. Handing this
    loop a connection built on the caller's thread (e.g. main.py's own
    `health_conn`) fails exactly the same way a shared connection would;
    only a connection built ON this loop's own background thread works,
    which means this function has to be the one to build it. Callers
    just need `db.DB_PATH` already set correctly before this starts --
    true process-wide by the time `main.py`'s `_build_db_backed_provider`
    has run, the same way every other component in this codebase
    (dashboard, the Squid helpers) relies on `db.DB_PATH` already being
    right rather than being told the path directly.

    A failed snapshot (the `ip` command missing, a transient subprocess
    error, a malformed line) is reported via `on_error` rather than
    killing the loop -- matching every other periodic task in this
    codebase (`HeartbeatPacer`, `main.py`'s own reconcile-cycle handling)
    in treating one bad cycle as a reason to log and retry next
    interval, not a reason to stop discovering devices entirely.
