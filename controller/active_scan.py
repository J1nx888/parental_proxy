"""Milestone 4's final discovery source: active, rate-limited ARP
scanning -- "only when stale or onboarding a new device"
(docs/design/phase3-technical-design.md's discovery precedence list).

Distinct from every other controller/*discovery*.py module in this
codebase: those all passively observe something else's traffic
(discovery.py reads the kernel's own `ip neigh show` state,
adguard_discovery.py reads AdGuard's query log). This module is the
only one that deliberately *provokes* fresh traffic -- nudging the
kernel's own neighbor-resolution state machine for a specific,
already-known-but-stale IP -- rather than just reading in a signal
that already exists on its own.

**Design decision, confirmed live against a real kernel on the
smoke-test VM (2026-08-31) before this was written -- see RoadMap.md's
dated entry for the full transcript:** the controller deliberately
holds no CAP_NET_RAW (only phase3/arp-worker does), so it cannot send
a real ARP request itself. It doesn't need to: opening a plain UDP
socket and sendto()-ing a closed port on the target IP is enough to
force the kernel's routing layer to (re)resolve that destination's
link-layer address as a side effect, even though the "connection"
itself always fails (a real ICMP port-unreachable, delivered
asynchronously, never surfaces as a Python exception on this send).
Confirmed live for both shapes this module needs: a completely absent
neighbor entry (transitions to INCOMPLETE -- the kernel attempting a
fresh resolution) and an already-stale one (kicks off re-verification)
-- no new op on phase3/arp-worker's IPC protocol (protocol.go/
dispatch.go) needed, keeping the controller/worker privilege split
unchanged.

This module ONLY ever nudges -- it never itself writes
device_bindings. Any resulting resolution (the device is genuinely
still on the LAN) is picked up by controller/discovery.py's own
already-running `ip neigh show` snapshot loop on its next tick,
recorded with source='snapshot' exactly like any other passively
observed entry -- deliberately not duplicated here. This mirrors
adguard_discovery.py's own narrow-scope precedent (one module, one
job, never re-implementing another module's write path); see that
module's docstring for the same reasoning applied to a different
source.

"Onboarding a new device" (the other half of the design doc's phrase)
isn't handled by this module at all: there is no IP to nudge for a
device this table has no binding row for yet -- discovering a
brand-new device is inherently something only a passive/link-layer
source (rtnetlink, the snapshot loop, or the device itself sending
unprompted traffic) can ever do. This module's whole job is refreshing
bindings that already exist but have gone quiet.
