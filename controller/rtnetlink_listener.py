"""Milestone 4's higher-precedence discovery source (see
docs/design/phase3-technical-design.md's discovery precedence order): a
live rtnetlink listener for `RTM_NEWNEIGH` events, reacting within
however long the kernel takes to deliver the netlink message --
effectively instant, versus `controller/discovery.py`'s periodic
`ip neigh show` snapshot, which can miss a device's new IP for up to a
full `--discovery-interval`. Closes the exact gap that module's own
docstring and `docs/security/overview.md` §3 both flag by name.

Uses `pyroute2` (see `controller/requirements.txt`) -- pure Python, no C
extension needed (confirmed via PyPI metadata), the one deliberate
exception to this project's otherwise-stdlib-only controller/common
code, for the one thing the stdlib genuinely doesn't expose a usable
API for (parsing `RTM_NEWNEIGH` netlink messages -- raw `AF_NETLINK`
sockets ARE available via Python's own `socket` module, but decoding
their contents by hand is squarely what pyroute2 already does well).
Always imported lazily, inside functions, never at module level --
`pyroute2` is Linux-only (no `AF_NETLINK` on Windows), and this module
must stay importable (for tests, and for `controller/main.py` itself)
on this project's Windows dev machine.

Deliberately reacts to `RTM_NEWNEIGH` only, never `RTM_DELNEIGH` --
mirrors `discovery.py`'s own philosophy exactly: a binding goes stale by
being *replaced* (a fresh, conflicting observation -- see
`common/identity.py`'s `record_binding()`), never by the mere absence of
one. A neighbor entry aging out of the kernel's own ARP cache is not
proof a device is gone (could be a completely normal cache timeout for a
device still very much present), so treating a `DELNEIGH` as "deactivate
this binding" would be over-reacting to absence -- exactly the kind of
inference `identity.py`'s own docstring already warns against for a
different case (never auto-associating a MAC from network data alone).

Real message shape confirmed live 2026-08-30 (pyroute2 0.9.6, a real
Linux kernel, real Docker bridge traffic) before writing this, not
assumed from documentation:
- `family` distinguishes real IPv4 ARP neighbors (`socket.AF_INET`, 2)
  from `AF_BRIDGE` FDB-learning noise (7, no `NDA_DST` at all -- these
  dominate event volume on a Docker host and are NOT ARP/NDP entries at
  all) and IPv6 neighbor discovery (`socket.AF_INET6`, 10, out of scope
  -- this project's `device_bindings` model is IPv4-only throughout).
- `state` is an integer `NUD_*` bitmask
  (`include/uapi/linux/neighbour.h`), not the string names
  `ip neigh show`'s text output uses -- observed as always exactly one
  bit set in practice, but checked as a bitmask
  (`state & _TRUSTED_STATE_MASK`) to match the kernel's own field
  definition rather than assume that never changes.
- `attrs` is a list of `(name, value)` tuples; `NDA_DST`/`NDA_LLADDR`
  carry the IP/MAC respectively, and either can be absent (e.g. an
  `INCOMPLETE` entry has no `NDA_LLADDR` yet) -- both are required here.
