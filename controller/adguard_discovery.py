"""Milestone 4's remaining "AdGuard query-log observations (confirms
active IP usage)" discovery source (RoadMap.md's discovery precedence
list). Distinct from -- and much narrower than -- adguard_sync.py,
which pushes hard-deny rules TO AdGuard; this module only ever reads
FROM it.

AdGuard's query log has no link-layer information (a DNS query carries
a client IP, never a MAC), so this source can never discover a
brand-new device_bindings row on its own -- only refresh last_seen_at
for a binding some other source (rtnetlink, the periodic snapshot)
already created. See common/identity.py's touch_binding_by_ip, the one
write this module ever makes.
