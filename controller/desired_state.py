    """Every non-ignored device with a currently-active IPv4 binding
    becomes a poisoning target.

    `devices.is_authenticated` deliberately plays no part here: per
    docs/design/phase3-technical-design.md section 5, interception
    scope and auth/policy scope are different axes -- an authenticated
    or not-yet-authenticated device is poisoned exactly the same way,
    only nftables set membership (not built yet) is meant to vary by
    that flag. `ignored` is the only exclusion here, standing in for
    the design's `bypass_v4` class: it already carries exactly the
    "never touch this device" semantic (the admin's own laptop, a
    guest's phone, or the gateway/Beelink itself entered as an ignored
    device), so this doesn't introduce a second, differently-named
    concept for the same thing. The worker's own ValidateTargets (see
    phase3/arp-worker/internal/worker/safety.go) independently rejects
    the gateway/self/broadcast/multicast regardless of what's sent
    here, as defense in depth -- this function does not duplicate that
    check.

    A device with more than one simultaneously-active binding (see
    common/identity.py's conflict-handling notes for how that can
    briefly happen) contributes only its most-recently-seen one.
