    Every public method that talks on the wire holds an internal lock
    for the full duration of its own send-then-await-reply exchange,
    which is what actually makes it safe to call heartbeat() from a
    background pacer thread (see controller/lease.py) at the same time
    controller/main.py's reconciliation loop calls replace_targets()/
    shutdown() from the main thread -- an earlier version of this class
    claimed this was already safe "by construction" without any lock,
    which was not true: two threads calling _send()/_read_frame()
    concurrently could interleave their writes on the shared socket or
    race on the shared read buffer, corrupting the JSON stream. Found
    while building an integration test for controller/main.py's
    reconnect-on-WorkerConnectionError logic with tight
    heartbeat/poll intervals -- exactly the conditions likely to
    surface it. This still matches the worker's own "single connection
    at a time" design (phase3/arp-worker/internal/ipc/server.go's doc
    comment) -- only one LOGICAL request is ever in flight on the wire
    at once, the lock just makes that true under real concurrency
    instead of by unenforced convention.
