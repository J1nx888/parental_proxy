"""Pushes two independent sets of DNS-tier enforcement rules to AdGuard
Home, both via its per-client custom filtering rules (see
common/adguard_client.py's docstring for how that's verified to
actually work), both built by the same shared engine
(`_build_domain_deny_rules()`):

1. `build_rules()` -- a domain marked `domains.mode = 'bump'` must NEVER
   be reachable via plain, unrefined DNS-tier access UNLESS the
   requesting device is both currently `bump_eligible()`
   (`common/policy_class.py`) AND that specific domain is actually
   assigned to it (`is_global`, or a user/group/device grant) -- refined
   through Squid, or denied outright, never a silent DNS-tier fallback.
2. `build_splice_deny_rules()` (added 2026-08-31, GH #9) -- enforces the
   same per-user/group/device/everyone domain assignment the dashboard's
   Domains page already manages, for `mode = 'splice'` domains -- the
   tier most devices actually use, since bump is a deliberately small
   curated set. See that function's own docstring for the gap this
   closed (this module used to do ONLY #1).

**Reworked 2026-08-31, per the project owner's explicit design
clarification (RoadMap.md's dated entry, GH #9)**: `build_rules()` used
to ONLY check bump-eligibility, giving any bump-eligible device a free
DNS pass to every `bump`-mode domain and relying entirely on Squid's own
`authz_helper.decide()` to catch a domain that specific device/user
wasn't actually assigned, after decryption. AdGuard now checks the same
assignment before the DNS query even resolves, for both modes -- one
shared engine, `_build_domain_deny_rules()`, that also excludes any
device classified `BYPASS` (`ignored=1`) from every rule it builds, on
either mode ("AdGuard should apply a baseline of protection... unless
the device/user/group is set to bypass/ignore" -- the project owner's
own words). See that function's own docstring for the full algorithm.

nftables has no domain visibility to enforce either of these itself (it
can only redirect by IP+port, see knftables_adapter.go's own comment on
this exact point), so both happen here, at the DNS tier, before a
connection to that domain is even attempted.

Same idempotent-full-reconcile shape as everywhere else in this
codebase (phase3/nftables-manager's flush-before-re-add,
controller/policy_state.py's full DesiredPolicy recompute every cycle):
every sync reads the DB and AdGuard's current rules fresh, computes the
complete desired managed-rules block (both rule sets combined), and
replaces it whole -- no incremental add/remove, no assumption about
what a previous cycle left behind.

**Phase 8 addendum (2026-08-31)**: content-category blocking
(`build_category_deny_rules()`) adds a THIRD rule source to the same
managed block, for categories at or under
`matching.MAX_SCOPED_CATEGORY_DOMAINS` domains. Real category blocklists
(confirmed live: https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists) range from
tens of domains to ~953K -- scoping a list that size to a subset of
clients via `$client=` is exactly what AdGuard's own team calls
"unworkable" for per-client blocklist assignment
(AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome#8103: "requires maintaining thousands of rules
for each client profile"). A category over that threshold is therefore
`is_global`-only (enforced by the dashboard, not re-checked here) and
handled by an entirely separate mechanism, `sync_category_subscriptions()`
-- pushing the category's own `subscription_url` into AdGuard as one of
ITS OWN native managed filter lists instead of expanding it into custom
rules, letting AdGuard's engine (built for exactly this) match it. See
each function's own docstring.

    row of the given `mode`, computes which currently-bound devices are
    NOT authorized for it and emits one `$client=`-scoped deny rule per
    domain (skipped entirely if nobody needs denying for it).

    **Reworked 2026-08-31, per the project owner's explicit direction on
    tighter Squid/AdGuard integration (RoadMap.md's dated entry, GH #9)**:
    a device is authorized for a domain when
    `matching.device_domain_reason()` (common/matching.py) returns
    non-None -- `is_global`, or an explicit user/group/device grant --
    AND, when `require_bump_eligible` is set, `policy_class.bump_eligible()`
    is ALSO true. That `AND` is the actual behavior change: previously
    (`build_rules()` before this rework) a `bump`-mode domain was only
    ever denied to devices that weren't bump-eligible at all -- a
    bump-eligible device got a free DNS pass to ANY bump-mode domain
    regardless of whether that SPECIFIC domain was assigned to it,
    relying entirely on Squid's own `authz_helper.decide()` to catch an
    unassigned one after decryption. Now AdGuard checks the same
    assignment `authz_helper.py` would check, before the DNS query even
    resolves -- a bump-eligible device only gets a clean resolution for a
    bump-mode domain that's actually `is_global` or assigned to it (via
    its user, group, or the device itself); an unassigned one is denied
    here, and the connection never reaches Squid at all. `is_global` on a
    bump-mode domain still only ever means "assigned to everyone", never
    "skip the bump-eligibility gate too" -- a non-bump-eligible device is
    still denied a global bump domain exactly as before.

    **A device classified `BYPASS` (`ignored=1`,
    `policy_class.classify_device()`) is excluded entirely** -- never
    added to any deny rule, on any domain, regardless of mode. Per the
    project owner's explicit direction the same day: "AdGuard DNS should
    apply a baseline of protection against all devices/users/groups
    unless the device/user/group is set to bypass/ignore." (`bypass_login`
    is deliberately NOT the same thing here -- see `classify_device()`'s
    own docstring; a `bypass_login` device still belongs to whatever
    user/group it's assigned to and is filtered normally. The dashboard's
    `update_device()`/`bypass_login_device()` routes default a newly
    `bypass_login`'d device to `ignored=1` too, but that's a UI default,
    not a rule this function enforces -- an admin can still un-ignore one
    while leaving `bypass_login` on.) An ignored device's packets never
    actually reach AdGuard's redirected port in the first place under
    normal ARP-spoofed interception (nftables' `bypass_v4` `return` --
    see `knftables_adapter.go`), so this exclusion is defense-in-depth
    for anything that ever points a device's DNS at this box directly
    (e.g. a manually-configured upstream), not a behavior change for the
    interception path itself.

    Deliberately still not filtered by `quarantined_at` on its own: a
    quarantined device's packets are dropped outright at the network
    layer (`quarantine_v4 counter drop`) regardless of what AdGuard says,
    so it's moot either way -- left to fall through the normal
    `device_domain_reason()` check rather than special-cased, since the
    project owner didn't ask for quarantine-specific handling here.

    Scope for `mode='splice'` (locked with the project owner, see
    RoadMap.md): only domains that HAVE a `domains` row. A domain with no
    row at all is unchanged -- deliberately still default-allow at the
    DNS tier in this pass; default-deny-for-unconfigured is a separate
    future decision.

    A device with no currently-active `device_bindings` row contributes
    no IP -- there's nothing to add a rule for yet; the same
    DHCP-staleness bound as `controller/discovery.py`'s snapshot loop
    applies here (a device's new IP is only picked up once discovery
    records it, and only enforced once the next adguard_sync cycle runs
    after that).

    for why a huge list needs AdGuard's own filtering engine rather than
    this project's `$client=`-scoped custom rules.

    Only two things can make an over-threshold category's subscription
    ENABLED: `categories.is_global` set directly (always enabled), or an
    `is_global`, non-`lockout_all` schedule referencing it via
    `schedule_categories` whose window is currently active
    (`schedule_eval.schedule_is_active()`) -- enabled only while that
    window is open. **This function does not, and cannot, enforce a
    per-user/device/group scoping for an over-threshold category** -- the
    dashboard's category routes (`dashboard/dashboard.py`) are
    responsible for never letting one be configured that way in the first
    place; a category assigned any other way would be silently
    under-enforced by the two-driver check above, so that configuration
    must never reach this function.

    Adds a subscription that doesn't exist in AdGuard yet
    (`adguard_client.add_filter_url()`), or flips `enabled` on one that
    already exists and disagrees with the computed state
    (`adguard_client.set_filter_url_enabled()`) -- never removes a
    subscription once added (disabling is sufficient, and removing would
    lose AdGuard's own last-fetched/rule-count state for no benefit).

    **NOT yet verified live** -- see `common/adguard_client.py`'s own note
    on the three functions this calls.
