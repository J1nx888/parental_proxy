"""Entrypoint for the interception-controller (Milestones 3/4/6/7
scaffold).

Wires a WorkerClient, a desired-state source, reconcile(), and the
heartbeat pacer together into the control loop RoadMap.md's Milestone 3
describes: versioned Unix-socket IPC, generations, leases, idempotent
reconciliation. Milestone 6 adds systemd sd_notify/watchdog integration
and interception_runtime health reporting; Milestone 7 adds computing
and publishing the DesiredPolicy blob phase3/nftables-manager reads.

NOT a real deployable yet: --db-path wires in the real Milestone 4
desired-state source (controller/desired_state.py, devices +
device_bindings), but there's still no Dockerfile/systemd unit for this
component, and the gateway is passed in on the command line rather than
resolved live (that's the ARP worker's own job at startup -- see
phase3/arp-worker/internal/worker/safety.go's ResolveGateway -- not
something the controller should do a second time). See
docs/design/phase3-technical-design.md and RoadMap.md's milestone list.

**Discovery is now wired in (2026-08-30)**: when --db-path is given,
run() also starts controller/discovery.py's snapshot loop on its own
background thread and its own DB connection (see discovery.run_loop's
own docstring for why a separate connection is required). This is still
only the periodic ip-neigh-show snapshot -- the higher-precedence live
rtnetlink-event listener remains unbuilt (see discovery.py's module
docstring).

    """The main control loop. Runs until SIGTERM/SIGINT.

    Registering the signal handlers here (rather than in main()) is
    deliberate: run() is also what a future integration test would call
    directly against a real worker socket, and it should be
    self-contained regardless of caller.

    health_conn/policy_conn are separate parameters (even though
    they're typically the same connection in practice -- see
    _build_db_backed_provider) because they're conceptually independent:
    a caller could report health without computing policy, or vice
    versa, and keeping them distinct avoids run() assuming its caller's
    wiring. Either or both may be None.

    discovery_interval, if given (not None), starts discovery.py's
    periodic `ip neigh show` snapshot on its own background thread and
    its own DB connection (see discovery.run_loop's own docstring for
    why it must open that connection itself rather than being handed
    health_conn/policy_conn) for the duration of this call, stopped in
    the `finally` block below alongside the heartbeat pacer. None (the
    default) means no discovery loop runs, matching this parameter's
    absence before 2026-08-30 -- existing callers that don't pass it see
    no behavior change.

    enable_rtnetlink, if True, starts
    controller/rtnetlink_listener.py's live RTM_NEWNEIGH listener
    alongside the discovery snapshot loop above -- the higher-precedence
    source discovery.py's own docstring flagged as still unbuilt until
    2026-08-30. Also stopped in the `finally` block below. Independent
    of discovery_interval -- both can run together (the snapshot catches
    anything the live listener missed, e.g. a device already-idle before
    this process started), matching the design doc's own layered
    precedence order rather than one replacing the other.

    adguard_interval, if given (not None), starts
    controller/adguard_sync.py's periodic hard-deny sync on its own
    background thread and its own DB connection (same reasoning as
    discovery_interval above) for the duration of this call, stopped in
    the `finally` block alongside the heartbeat pacer and discovery
    task. adguard_url/adguard_username/adguard_password are required
    together with it -- see main()'s own argument validation.
    adguard_discovery_interval, if given (not None), starts
    controller/adguard_discovery.py's periodic querylog correlation on
    its own background thread and its own DB connection (same reasoning
    as discovery_interval above) -- Milestone 4's "AdGuard query-log
    observations (confirms active IP usage)" discovery source. Only
    refreshes last_seen_at for bindings another source already created;
    never creates one on its own (AdGuard's query log has no MAC).
    Independent of adguard_interval -- one pushes hard-deny rules TO
    AdGuard, the other only reads FROM it -- both require adguard_url/
    adguard_username/adguard_password when set.

    active_scan_interval, if given (not None), starts
    controller/active_scan.py's periodic rate-limited ARP-nudge loop on
    its own background thread and its own DB connection (same reasoning
    as discovery_interval above) -- Milestone 4's final discovery
    source, "active, rate-limited ARP scanning (only when stale or
    onboarding a new device)." Requires no adguard_url/credentials
    (unlike adguard_interval/adguard_discovery_interval above) since it
    never touches AdGuard at all -- it only nudges the kernel's own
    neighbor-resolution state for stale device_bindings rows;
    controller/discovery.py's own already-running snapshot loop is what
    actually observes and records any resulting resolution (see
    active_scan.py's module docstring). active_scan_stale_after/
    active_scan_limit control, respectively, how old last_seen_at must
    be before a binding is nudged and how many bindings get nudged per
    cycle -- the rate limit that keeps this from becoming a scan storm
    on a large household LAN.
    block_page_ip, if given, is threaded through to
    adguard_sync.build_rules() so hard-deny rules also carry a
    $dnsrewrite pointing at that IP's port 80 (see
    dashboard/block_page_server.py) instead of a bare deny -- optional
    even when adguard_interval is set, and silently ignored (see
    main()'s own _parse_block_page_ip) if not a plain IPv4 address.

    A single failed reconcile cycle (a worker fault, a transient DB
    error) is logged and reported via health_conn rather than crashing
    the process -- matching the fail-open design's "controller drives
    repair, not a crash" intent (RoadMap.md's Milestone 9 fault-
    campaign). If the underlying socket itself dies (WorkerConnectionError
    -- a broken pipe, connection reset, or EOF, as opposed to a healthy
    connection carrying an application-level fault), run() closes the
    dead client and tries exactly one fresh connection per loop
    iteration -- naturally rate-limited to poll_interval without needing
    explicit backoff, and still responsive to a stop request every
    iteration. `applied` is reset to None on reconnect: a freshly
    (re)connected worker process may be a brand-new process (systemd
    restarted it) with no memory of any prior generation, so the next
    cycle must treat this as a first application again rather than
    possibly skipping a resend because desired state happens not to
    have changed since the connection dropped.

    **This reconnect path is also triggered by a failed heartbeat, not
    just a failed run_cycle() (added 2026-08-30, a real gap found during
    this project's first live-container verification pass)**: if
    desired state never changes across a worker restart, run_cycle()'s
    own reconcile() correctly returns None every time (nothing new to
    send) and never touches the connection at all -- with an unchanging
    desired state, a dead worker could previously go undetected
    indefinitely, since the heartbeat pacer's own failures were only
    ever logged, never acted on. The heartbeat pacer is the one thing
    that touches the connection every single cycle regardless of
    desired state, which is what makes it the thing that actually
    notices. `heartbeat_worker_dead` (a threading.Event set by the
    pacer's on_error callback, checked at the top of the main loop)
    routes a heartbeat-detected failure through the exact same
    `_reconnect()` codepath run_cycle()'s own WorkerConnectionError
    uses, rather than duplicating the reconnect logic.

    Known race, accepted rather than fixed here given the scope of this
    pass: the heartbeat pacer runs on its own thread and reads `client`
    from this closure at call time. If it fires in the narrow window
    between closing a dead client and a fresh one being assigned, its
    heartbeat call raises AttributeError on None -- HeartbeatPacer's own
    broad exception handling logs it via on_error rather than crashing,
    so this is a harmless, if noisy, cosmetic race, not a correctness
    bug. A future pass could add a lock around client reads/writes if
    the noise proves annoying in practice.

    worker_ready_timeout/adguard_ready_timeout (Milestone 6's readiness
    gates, added 2026-08-31 -- see controller/readiness.py) bound how
    long this call blocks waiting for each real dependency to actually
    answer, rather than just having started: the initial worker connect
    below retries for up to worker_ready_timeout seconds instead of
    failing on the very first attempt (closing the ordinary "arp-worker
    hasn't created its socket file yet" startup race docker-compose.yml's
    own comment already documented as an accepted one-restart-cycle gap
    -- this makes that restart far less often necessary, it doesn't
    remove Docker's restart policy as the fallback if the worker is
    genuinely never going to come up). adguard_ready_timeout similarly
    bounds a best-effort wait for AdGuard before starting the periodic
    sync loop and calling sdnotify.ready() -- but, unlike the worker
    socket, never raises: AdGuard isn't required for the rest of this
    function, and adguard_sync.py's own run_loop() already retries
    forever on its own schedule regardless of this gate's outcome.
