"""Shared pytest fixtures for the parental_proxy Tier-1 (no-Docker) suite.

Every component in this repo is deployed as a *flat* directory in its
container (see the Dockerfiles): common/*.py, the proxy helpers, and
defaults/seed_defaults.py are all copied into /opt/parental-proxy/, and
common/*.py + dashboard.py are copied into /app/ for the dashboard image.
Every module therefore does bare imports like ``import db`` or
``import cr_api``, not ``from common import db``. To exercise the real code
unmodified, this conftest puts all four source directories directly on
sys.path (flat, no package layer) instead of using a src-layout/PYTHONPATH
trick that would require touching the modules under test.

No Docker, no network, no external services -- see the autouse
``block_network`` fixture below.
