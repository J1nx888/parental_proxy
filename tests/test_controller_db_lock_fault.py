"""Milestone 9 fault-campaign coverage: a transient SQLite lock from a
concurrent writer must not crash the controller's health/policy writes
-- common/db.py's get_conn() sets busy_timeout=5000, so a short-lived
lock from another connection should just be a brief wait, not a hard
failure that would otherwise take down run_cycle's health reporting.
