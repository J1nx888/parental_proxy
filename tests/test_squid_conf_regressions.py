"""Regression tests for two real bugs found running against a live Squid
instance (2026-08-28 smoke test), both in proxy/squid.conf.template.
Neither is the kind of thing a pure Python unit test of the helper *logic*
can catch -- both are about Squid's own ACL/protocol semantics -- so these
tests check the config's text/structure directly instead.

1. Every external_acl_type FORMAT string was missing an explicit %DATA
   macro. Squid always appends %DATA to an external_acl_type FORMAT unless
   it's already present (documented Squid behavior), so every helper was
   receiving one more field on the wire than its registered field_count
   expected -- every line was rejected as malformed, and every real request
   fell through to `ssl_bump terminate step2 all`. Fails closed (nothing
   loads) but the entire SNI/authz decision layer never worked at all.

2. `http_access allow step1`/`step2`, left bare, also grants access to the
   real *decrypted* HTTP request that follows a bump decision -- Squid's
   at_step state doesn't reset after step2 is reached. This bypassed
   authz_allowed entirely for every bump-mode request (any Crunchyroll show,
   approved or not) -- fails OPEN, the more serious direction. Fixed by
   qualifying both with CONNECT, which only matches during the tunnel/
   negotiation phase.

proxy/basic_auth_helper.py (and the auth_param basic percent-encoding
regression that used to be tested here) was removed 2026-08-30 along with
the rest of Squid's explicit-proxy-with-login model -- see RoadMap.md's
"Squid: explicit-proxy-with-login -> transparent intercept" section. Squid
now runs in native intercept mode with no per-request login at all, so
there is nothing left for that helper (or these tests) to cover.
