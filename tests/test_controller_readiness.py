"""controller/readiness.py: Milestone 6's startup-readiness gates.

wait_for_worker() is tested against a real listening AF_UNIX socket
(not a socketpair) since it calls WorkerClient.connect(path) itself --
same reasoning as test_controller_run_integration.py. wait_for_adguard()
fakes adguard_client, same as test_controller_adguard_sync.py, since it
has no AF_UNIX dependency and should run on every platform.

Every test that needs fake timing passes `sleep=`/`now=` EXPLICITLY to
wait_for_worker()/wait_for_adguard() rather than monkeypatching
readiness.time.sleep/readiness.time.monotonic -- those two functions'
own `sleep=time.sleep, now=time.monotonic` defaults are bound to the
real functions at module-IMPORT time (ordinary Python default-argument
binding), so patching the `time` module's attributes afterward has no
effect on a default that already captured the original function
object. Found the hard way: an earlier version of this file did exactly
that monkeypatch, which silently made three "fast" tests run on real
wall-clock sleeps instead (masked because their assertions didn't
depend on speed, just eventual outcome) and made a fourth
(test_wait_for_worker_retries_until_the_socket_appears) genuinely fail
on Linux, once real AF_UNIX sockets made the test collectable there --
its side effect (creating the socket file) was wired to the fake
sleep(), which was never actually being called.
