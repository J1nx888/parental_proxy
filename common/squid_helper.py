"""Shared stdin/stdout loop for the Squid helper scripts.

Squid speaks one line protocol to every ``external_acl_type`` helper: one
request per line, fields separated by a single space, reply ``OK`` or
``ERR`` flushed immediately. The two helpers (sni, authz) differ only in
the field count and the decision function -- everything else lived
duplicated in each ``main()`` before this module.

A third helper, basic_auth_helper (``auth_param basic``, per-login
Basic-Auth), was removed 2026-08-30 along with Squid's explicit-proxy
model -- see RoadMap.md's Squid intercept-mode section. The ``unquote``/
``keep_trailing_spaces`` parameters below predate that removal: both
current callers always percent-encode (``external_acl_type``'s own
protocol) and need no trailing-space handling, so both now always pass
their defaults -- kept as parameters rather than inlined, since they're
still real, independently testable protocol variations (see
tests/test_helpers_protocol.py's own protocol-level tests), not dead code.
