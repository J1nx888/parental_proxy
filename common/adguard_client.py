"""Thin REST client for AdGuard Home's `/control` API.

This is what makes the "two independent axes" hard-deny invariant real
(RoadMap.md, locked 2026-08-30): a domain marked `domains.mode = 'bump'`
must never resolve normally for a device that isn't `bump_enabled` --
nftables has no domain visibility to enforce this itself (see
knftables_adapter.go's own comment), so it has to happen here, at the
DNS tier, before a connection to that domain is even attempted.

Verified live 2026-08-30 against a real AdGuard Home v0.107.79 instance
-- not written from documentation alone, matching this project's own
repeated lesson that a first draft written from memory/docs tends to be
subtly wrong in exactly the way that only shows up against the real
thing (the ARP worker's mdlayher/arp adapter, the nftables adapter's
import path, three separate Squid startup bugs this same session):
- `/control/filtering/set_rules` (POST, body `{"rules": [...]}`) does a
  full replace of AdGuard's custom filtering rules -- no incremental
  add/remove API exists, matching this project's own established
  full-reconcile pattern (phase3/nftables-manager's flush-before-re-add,
  controller's full DesiredPolicy recompute every cycle).
- `/control/filtering/status` (GET) echoes the current list back under
  a `user_rules` key.
- HTTP Basic Auth works directly against `/control/*` for a configured
  instance -- no cookie-based `/control/login` session dance needed.
- The `$client=ip1,ip2` modifier on a custom rule does exactly what it
  says: confirmed with two real client containers against a real
  instance, one resolving a domain normally and the other -- named in
  the rule's $client list -- getting `0.0.0.0` back for the identical
  query.
- `/control/install/configure` (POST) is what the first-run setup
  wizard itself calls -- NOT the bare `/install/configure` path some of
  AdGuard's own generated OpenAPI-doc tooling implies (every route
  lives under `/control`, even before the instance is configured at
  all). It writes a complete, correctly-versioned AdGuardHome.yaml
  itself; see adguard/entrypoint.sh, which calls this once on first
  boot instead of hand-templating that file (confirmed live that a
  hand-authored version, built from the wiki's documented fields alone,
  was missing several fields the real binary always writes --
  `session_ttl` format, `upstream_mode`, `cache_optimistic_*`,
  `doh.routes` -- so letting AdGuard build its own config is both
  simpler and version-correct in a way a template can't be kept in sync
  with automatically).
- `/control/filtering/status`'s `user_rules` key is present but `null`,
  not `[]`, on a freshly-configured instance that has never had a custom
  rule set -- confirmed live 2026-08-30 running the full interception
  stack against a brand-new AdGuard container for the first time ever
  (every earlier live AdGuard test this project ran had already pushed
  at least one custom rule by the time `get_custom_rules` was exercised,
  which is exactly why this hadn't surfaced before). `get_custom_rules`
  below treats that ONE specific shape -- key present, value `null` --
  as "no rules yet" (empty list), same as `[]`. It deliberately does NOT
  extend the same treatment to a missing key or a non-object response:
  an early version of this fix did, and a code review the same day
  caught that this let `sync_once()` silently proceed to a destructive
  full-replace write on what could be a genuinely malformed response
  (wrong endpoint, incompatible AdGuard version) rather than the
  confirmed benign case -- those still raise `AdGuardError` and fail
  closed, exactly as before this fix existed.
- `/control/querylog?limit=N` (GET) returns `{"data": [...], "oldest":
  "<timestamp>"}`, newest-first -- confirmed live 2026-08-31 by
  generating real DNS queries against a running instance and reading
  the response back. Each entry's `client` field is a plain IP string
  (no MAC -- DNS carries no link-layer information) and `time` is
  ISO8601 UTC with variable-precision fractional seconds (commonly
  9-digit/nanosecond, e.g. `"2026-08-31T13:17:13.089285447Z"`) -- see
  `normalize_query_log_time` below for why that can't be compared as a
  plain string against this project's own `db.now_iso()` timestamps.

No third-party dependencies -- matches common/cr_api.py's own
urllib-based pattern, mirrored here, rather than adding `requests` to a
package this project otherwise keeps stdlib-only outside dashboard/.
