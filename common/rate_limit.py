"""A small, in-memory, per-key sliding-window rate limiter for login-style
brute-force protection.

Added 2026-09-02, factored out of `dashboard/captive_portal_server.py`'s
own original hand-rolled limiter (its kid-login/portal-admin-action forms)
so `dashboard/dashboard.py`'s HTTP-Basic admin login -- audited the same
day and found to have NO brute-force protection at all, unlike the portal
-- can reuse the exact same, already-reasoned-about mechanism instead of a
second copy. See docs/security/overview.md section 6 for the audit that
found the gap, and RoadMap.md's dated entry for the full writeup.

Stdlib-only (`threading` + `time`) -- this module is flat-copied into
every image that copies `common/*.py` (see each Dockerfile's own `COPY`
line), including the `proxy` container, which must never need `pip` (see
`common/auth.py`'s own docstring on the same constraint). Nothing in
`proxy/` currently imports this module, but it must stay stdlib-only
regardless, on the same footing as everything else in `common/`.

In-memory, per-process, deliberately not a new DB table: losing lockout
state across a process restart is an accepted tradeoff for a first pass on
a LAN-only deployment -- the same call the portal's original limiter made.
Each login surface should hold its OWN module-level `RateLimiter` instance
rather than sharing one between logically different surfaces (unless that
sharing is itself a deliberate choice, as it is between the portal's kid
login and its own admin action -- see that module's docstring) -- state
has to live somewhere that outlives any single request/connection, and a
flood against one surface should never exhaust a different surface's own
budget.

    """Tracks failed attempts per key (e.g. a source IP) in a sliding
    window. Thread-safe: Flask's waitress runs multiple worker threads,
    and `captive_portal_server.py`'s `ThreadingHTTPServer` hands each
    connection its own thread -- both can call the same instance's
    methods concurrently.

    Known, accepted tradeoff: a key that is checked but never actually
    fails again (an attacker who gives up, or a legitimate user who
    later logs in successfully via `clear()`) still leaves a tiny empty
    list behind in the internal dict rather than being removed as a key
    entirely -- unbounded in theory over a process's lifetime, but bounded
    in practice by the number of distinct source IPs ever seen, each
    costing a few bytes. Not worth an eviction thread for a household
    LAN's realistic IP churn; revisit if this is ever exposed beyond one.
