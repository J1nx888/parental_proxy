    succeeds, never rejecting a catastrophic-backtracking shape (e.g. a
    pattern with nested/overlapping quantifiers). Python's stdlib `re`
    has no linear-time guarantee the way RE2 does, and this project's
    common/ modules are deliberately stdlib-only (see common/auth.py's
    own docstring on why -- the proxy container must never need pip),
    so a third-party guaranteed-linear engine isn't an option here.

    The actual attacker-facing risk: proxy/authz_helper.py's decide()
    (the only real caller, via path_allowed() below) runs this against
    the CLIENT-controlled request path on every bump-mode HTTP request,
    inside one of Squid's pooled `children-max=20` helper subprocesses
    -- a hung match there stalls that one child indefinitely, and
    enough hung children measurably degrade every other in-flight
    bump-mode decision.

    Uses SIGALRM (Unix only, and only callable from the interpreter's
    main thread) since that's the actual context this runs in --
    authz_helper.py is a single-threaded subprocess reading stdin in a
    loop, never multi-threaded. Falls back to an UNGUARDED search
    (never silently skipping the match, just not time-bounding it) on
    Windows (SIGALRM doesn't exist there -- fine, since proxy/ only
    ever actually runs on Linux, see AGENTS.md) or if this is ever
    called from a non-main thread (`signal.signal()` raises ValueError
    there) -- e.g. a future test or caller from dashboard.py's
    multi-threaded waitress workers. A timeout denies (fails closed),
    consistent with this project's fail-closed convention (see
    docs/architecture/overview.md's "everything is fail-closed by
