"""Milestone 7/8: the PolicyClass concept from RoadMap.md -- what
interception POLICY applies to a device, independent of whether it's
being ARP-spoofed at all (spoofing scope is
controller/desired_state.py's job; this is a different axis, per
docs/design/phase3-technical-design.md section 5).

Matches phase3/nftables-manager/internal/policy's four mutually-exclusive
sets 1:1 -- PolicyClass here uses RoadMap.md's own naming (AUTHENTICATED/
PREAUTH/BYPASS/QUARANTINE); to_set_name() bridges to the nftables set names
(authenticated/unauthenticated/bypass/quarantine, matching
controller/policy_state.py's JSON keys and the Go side's DesiredPolicy
JSON tags exactly -- keep all three in sync if any changes).

`bump_eligible()` below is a SEPARATE, independent axis added for the
"two independent axes" architecture correction locked in RoadMap.md
2026-08-30: devices.bump_enabled is a per-device, admin-only opt-in for
Squid/SSL-bump refinement, layered on top of an already-authenticated
device -- not a fifth PolicyClass value. A device can be AUTHENTICATED
*and* bump_eligible at once; see bump_eligible()'s own doc comment for
why it is never true for any other PolicyClass.

      1. BYPASS       -- `ignored` devices (the admin's own laptop, or
                          the gateway/Beelink itself entered as
                          ignored -- see controller/desired_state.py's
                          own note on why `ignored` stands in for
                          bypass_v4).
      2. QUARANTINE   -- `quarantined_at` is set (operator-triggered
                          isolation; NULL means not quarantined -- no
                          dashboard control exists to set this yet,
                          see db.py's schema comment).

                          (the captive-portal gate's own flags; `is_authenticated`
                          defaulted to 1 before Phase 4 existed since there was
                          no login gate yet to fail -- Phase 4 milestone 1 now
                          creates new devices with it 0). `bypass_login` is a
                          SEPARATE way into AUTHENTICATED, added here
                          2026-08-31 fixing a real bug: this function never
                          consulted it at all before, despite the dashboard's
                          own device-detail hint text (and RoadMap.md's design
                          sketch) claiming "bypass_login exempts a device from
                          the captive-portal gate" -- a device an admin marked
                          bypass_login was, in reality, staying stuck in PREAUTH
                          forever, still redirected to the portal on every
                          request, since nothing here ever looked at that
                          column. `bypass_login` is deliberately NOT the same
                          as `ignored`/BYPASS: it only skips the LOGIN
                          requirement, not the whole interception/policy
                          system -- the device still gets DNS-tier
                          AUTHENTICATED treatment (and whatever group/user
                          assignment governs its domain access), it just never
                          has to actually log in to get there.

    `device_row` needs `ignored`, `quarantined_at`, `is_authenticated`,
    and `bypass_login` keys -- works with a sqlite3.Row or any
    Mapping-like object providing those.
