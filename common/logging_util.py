"""Access-log writer, shared by the SNI and HTTP-layer authz helpers.

Dedupes: the same (username, domain, allowed, series_id, path) combination
is only logged once per DEDUPE_WINDOW_SECONDS, so one browsing session
doesn't produce dozens of near-identical rows (repeated TLS connections,
page assets, polling requests, etc). The reporting page stays readable, and
"who accessed what and when" still reflects genuinely new activity.

`path` is compared with its query string stripped (GH #5): two requests to
the same page that only differ by a cache-busting or session query
parameter count as the same dedupe entry, but two genuinely different
pages on the same domain each get their own row -- previously `path` was
not part of the key at all, so a bump-mode domain visited normally (many
pages within the window, the common case) only ever showed its first page
in the Report. This also means a path-less entry (e.g. the SNI layer,
which never has a path since nothing is decrypted there) and a later
path-bearing entry for what's otherwise the same event are different keys
too, so a richer entry is never hidden behind an earlier, less
informative one for the same window.
