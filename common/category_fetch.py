"""Phase 8: fetches each `categories` row's `subscription_url` and
refreshes its `category_domains` rows.

Lives in common/ (not controller/), deliberately -- both
dashboard/dashboard.py's per-category "Sync now" button (an on-demand
call, no background loop) AND controller/main.py's scheduled
`run_loop()` below need this, and the two are separate container images
that each flat-copy common/*.py alongside their own directory's *.py
into ONE shared /app/ (see controller/Dockerfile's own comment on this
layout) -- a same-named file in both common/ and controller/ would
silently collide (whichever COPY ran last would win in each image),
exactly the trap common/adguard_client.py (the REST client, usable from
either image) vs. controller/adguard_sync.py (the scheduling/business
logic on top of it, controller-only since it's the one thing needing
controller/periodic.py) already avoids by the same split. `run_loop()`
below imports `periodic` lazily, INSIDE the function body, not at module
level, for exactly this reason: dashboard.py can safely `import
category_fetch` and call its other functions even though
controller/periodic.py was never copied into the dashboard image --
that import only actually executes if something calls `run_loop()`
itself, which dashboard.py never does.

Own tiny urllib client (`_OPENER`/`_fetch()`), same shape as
common/adguard_client.py's -- deliberately not reusing that module, since
this fetches arbitrary third-party blocklist files (not AdGuard's own
`/control/*` API), a genuinely different concern with its own error type.

Verified live 2026-08-31 that the actual file formats
(common/blocklist_parser.py's own docstring) match what's fetched here.
NOT yet verified: pushing a category's `subscription_url` into AdGuard
Home as one of ITS OWN native filter subscriptions -- see
controller/adguard_sync.py's docstring for why a large category can't go
through this project's own `$client=`-scoped custom rules instead, and
for the caveat on that native-subscription API shape.
