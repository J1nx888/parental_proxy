"""Phase 8: parses a fetched category blocklist's text into plain domain
names. Pure function, no network access (see controller/category_fetch.py
for the fetch side) -- verified live 2026-08-31 against real files from
https://github.com/blocklistproject/Lists (MIT), which serves the three
formats below.

Returns PLAIN, lowercased domain strings -- NOT regex-escaped. Callers
that store a result into `category_domains.pattern` (matched later via
common/matching.py's `_domain_regex()`-style suffix anchoring, same as
`domains.pattern`) are responsible for `re.escape()`-ing each one first,
same as `defaults/seed_defaults.py` hand-escapes its own seeded patterns
(e.g. `"google\\.com"`) -- kept as a separate step rather than done here,
so this module stays about text extraction only.

    plain domain names, preserving first-seen order. Supports, per line:

      - a full-line comment (`#` or `!` as the first non-whitespace
        character) or a blank line -- skipped.
      - hosts-file style: `0.0.0.0 example.com` (and the other
        _HOSTS_IP_PREFIXES) -- every whitespace-separated token after the
        IP is treated as a hostname (some hosts files list aliases on one

        modifiers (`$important`, etc. -- ignored).

    A line matching none of these shapes (malformed, or a rule type this
    parser doesn't understand -- e.g. a regex rule, an exception rule
    starting `@@`) is silently skipped, not raised on -- a category sync is
    a best-effort refresh of a large third-party file; one weird line
    should never abort the whole sync. Skipped-line volume isn't currently
    surfaced anywhere; if a real subscription source turns out to need
    more format coverage than this, that'll show up as a suspiciously
    small resulting category_domains count, worth keeping in mind if a
    future format needs adding here.
