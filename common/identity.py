    """Record one MAC<->IP observation.

    Idempotent for a repeated (mac, ip) pair -- just bumps last_seen_at.
    Handles the two conflict shapes the v2 roadmap's "MAC/IP conflict
    handling" requirement calls for, deactivating whichever prior
    binding is now stale and logging a network_events row for each:

      - IP reassigned: this ipv4_address was actively bound to a
        DIFFERENT mac_address (e.g. a departed device's DHCP lease
        reused by a new one).
      - Device moved: this mac_address was actively bound to a
        DIFFERENT ipv4_address (e.g. a normal DHCP lease renewal).

    Reuses whatever device_id (if any) an existing binding for the same
    mac_address already carries, or a `devices` row whose mac_address
    already matches -- this is never a heuristic guess (hostname/vendor
    matching, which the roadmap's "never auto-merge devices solely by
    hostname/vendor" rule forbids), only an exact mac_address match.

    **Phase 4 addition, 2026-08-31**: a MAC this function has genuinely
    NEVER seen before (no `devices` row, and no `device_bindings` row
    of any kind -- active or inactive -- has ever existed for it
    either) gets a brand-new, unassociated `devices` row auto-created
    for it (`is_authenticated = 0`, `ignored = 0`, no `user_id`) rather
    than being left with a dangling `device_id = NULL` binding
    requiring a human to notice and manually associate it. This closes
    a real gap `controller/desired_state.py`'s own docstring didn't
    used to have to think about: a `device_id = NULL` binding is
    invisible to that module's `JOIN`, so a brand-new device previously
    got NO interception of any kind (full, unfiltered access) until
    someone happened to visit the dashboard and create it manually --
    the opposite of Phase 4's "gate any newly-seen MAC by default."
    `is_authenticated = 0` (not the `devices` table's own schema
    default of `1`) is deliberate: that default exists for a device an
    admin creates directly through today's dashboard (an admin manually
    adding a device already implies trust), not for a MAC nobody has
    looked at yet -- see `common/policy_class.py`'s `classify_device()`,
    which puts a device with `is_authenticated = 0` into `PREAUTH`.

    This auto-create only ever fires the FIRST time a given MAC is ever
    recorded -- once any `device_bindings` row exists for a MAC (even
    an inactive, long-superseded one), this function never auto-creates
    a `devices` row for it again, so an already-known-but-unassociated
    device from before this feature shipped is deliberately left alone
    (per an explicit 2026-08-31 product decision: no retroactive
    backfill, only newly-observed MACs going forward) even across a
    later DHCP renewal.
