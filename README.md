# Parental Proxy v2

A from-scratch rewrite of the v1 Crunchyroll whitelist proxy, now aimed at
replacing a commercial whole-home filter (Bark Home) rather than just
Crunchyroll. Same core idea (an SSL-bumping Squid proxy enforcing what
gets through), rebuilt around four features:

1. **Everything is configured from the dashboard** -- no files to hand-edit,
   no `squid -k reconfigure`, no restart for any rule change. Even the LAN
   IP range and the dashboard's own admin password are editable from the
   web UI after first boot (seeded from `.env` only once, on first run).
2. **Identity comes from the device, not a login.** Squid runs in native
   intercept mode and resolves who's using it from the client's own IP via
   a MAC-keyed `devices` table (DHCP-safe: identity survives an IP
   change) -- there's no per-request Basic-Auth credential to manage
   anymore. Site/show permissions are assigned per person -- kid1 can
   reach `xyz.com` but not `abc.com`; kid2 can reach both.
3. **DNS-tier ad/tracker/malware blocking (AdGuard Home).** Curated
   uBlockOrigin/uAssets filter lists on top of AdGuard's own defaults,
   with a weekly auto-refresh and an on-demand "check now" button from
   Settings -- see "Ad-blocking" below. A separate, deliberately narrower
   SSL-Bump tier gets path- and show-level rules (Crunchyroll today).
4. **Reporting, with one-click approve -- and the kid can ask.** Every
   allow/block decision is logged with who, what, and when, filterable by
   kid and by date range (1/7/14/30 days) with at-a-glance graphs. A
   blocked entry gets Approve / Approve for everyone / Dismiss buttons, and
   the block page itself has a "Request approval" button -- a kid doesn't
   need to know the dashboard exists for their request to show up as a
   pending alert an admin can act on immediately.

This README describes the system **as it exists in code today**. Getting
a device's traffic to Squid at all -- so #2/#3 work without configuring
anything on the device itself -- is the job of a separate network-level
interception layer (ARP-based redirect plus an `nftables` policy engine):
it's built, containerized, and verified against a disposable test VM, but
is an opt-in Docker Compose profile (`--profile interception`) and has not
yet been run against a real household LAN. Until it is, or on a device you
haven't added there, filtering will not apply. A captive-portal enrollment
flow and YouTube channel-level filtering are designed but not yet built.
See [RoadMap.md](RoadMap.md) for the full plan and current status of each
piece.

## How it decides what to do with a site

Every domain has a **mode**, set from the dashboard:

- **`splice` (default)** -- host-only. Squid peeks at the TLS handshake
  (SNI), checks whether this user may reach that domain, and either passes
  the encrypted connection through untouched or terminates it. No
  decryption, no path-level detail, cheap. This is what "kid1 can reach
  xyz.com" means in practice.
- **`bump`** -- fully decrypted, for domains where path-level rules matter.
  Crunchyroll ships in this mode with show-level enforcement built on top
  (see below); you can put any other domain in `bump` mode too and get a
  per-domain allowed-paths list, same idea as v1's `allowed_paths.txt`.
- **`trusted`** -- always spliced, never checked, never logged. For known
  large-binary CDN traffic where there's nothing per-user to decide (the
  actual show-level decision already happened at the manifest/token
  request, which *is* bumped).

Every domain is also either **global** (every user gets it automatically --
for shared infrastructure like fonts, auth providers, analytics) or
**per-user** (each person needs an explicit assignment).

**Blocked-site experience is configurable (Settings → Blocked-site
experience):**

- **"Just fail the connection" (default).** Never decrypts a blocked
  attempt. Safe for any device, including one that hasn't installed the CA
  certificate yet -- the kid just sees a broken-looking connection with no
  explanation, and the report only ever has the domain (not the path) for
  `splice`-mode blocks.
- **"Show a friendly page."** A blocked `splice`-mode connection gets
  bumped -- decrypted -- just for that one connection, purely so a real
  deny page can be served instead of a bare connection failure (the same
  mechanism `bump`-mode domains already use). Two tradeoffs: the proxy
  briefly sees that blocked attempt's actual Host+Path before denying it
  (which it otherwise never would for a `splice`-mode site), and **this
  requires the CA certificate to already be trusted on the device**. If
  it isn't, decrypting the connection means presenting a certificate the
  device doesn't trust -- the browser shows a security warning
  ("connection not private") instead of a clean block message, which is a
  worse experience than the plain failure it replaces. Only turn this on
  after confirming certificate trust works (if a `bump`-mode site like
  Crunchyroll already loads cleanly on a device, that device is fine).
  This is a single setting for the whole deployment, not per-device.

Either way, allowed `splice`-mode traffic is never touched -- this setting
only affects what happens to connections that were already going to be
denied. And either way, clicking "Approve" (or "Approve for everyone") on
a report entry works even for a domain that was never configured before
-- it gets created automatically, scoped to that one user or made global.

## Crunchyroll specifically

Ships pre-configured as a global `bump`-mode domain. On top of the normal
domain/path checks, watch/playback/series requests get resolved to their
parent show via Crunchyroll's CMS API (cached in the database) and checked
against each user's individually-approved show list. This logic is
Crunchyroll-specific and stays that way -- nothing else has an API to
resolve "this URL belongs to this show," so it's not a generic feature.

## Ad-blocking (AdGuard Home)

Runs as its own container (`adguard/`), auto-bootstrapped on first start
(no manual AdGuard setup) with a curated set of uBlockOrigin/uAssets
filter lists layered on top of AdGuard's own default filter -- ads,
malware/badware domains, tracking, and their matching exceptions list.
Checks all subscribed lists for updates once a week by default
(`ADGUARD_FILTERS_UPDATE_INTERVAL_HOURS` in `.env`); Settings has a "Check
for filter updates now" button for whenever you don't want to wait.

This also closes a gap the SSL-Bump tier alone can't: a device that isn't
individually SSL-Bump-enabled still can't resolve a domain the household
has marked `bump`-mode (Crunchyroll, or anything else) at all -- AdGuard
returns a non-resolving answer for that specific device rather than
letting the connection through unfiltered. See [RoadMap.md](RoadMap.md)
for how the two enforcement tiers fit together, and this file's intro
above for what still has to be true on the network for either tier to
actually see a device's traffic today.

## The dashboard

Server-rendered (Flask + Jinja2, no separate frontend build) but styled as
a proper small app: cards, light/dark mode following the OS setting,
responsive down to phone width, and installable as a PWA (Add to Home
Screen) -- that last part needs a secure context (`localhost`, or HTTPS
once that's set up), so it won't offer to install over plain HTTP to a LAN
IP, but everything else works everywhere.

A collapsible left sidebar covers everything: **Report** (below), **Users**
(add a person, set/reset their password, see their approved shows/sites),
**Domains** (every domain's mode, global-vs-per-user access, per-domain
allowed paths), **Devices** (MAC-based device tracking, user/group
assignment, SSL-Bump toggle, group management), **Health** (only
meaningful once the interception layer's compose profile is running --
live status of the ARP/nftables pipeline, flagged as "stale" rather than
a false "healthy" if a component has crashed and stopped reporting), and
**Settings** (admin login, LAN CIDR, blocked-site experience, AdGuard
connection + filter-refresh, stale-device cleanup, CA certificate
download).

**Report page:**

- A stat strip (total / allowed / blocked / % blocked) where **Allowed**
  and **Blocked** are clickable -- click one to filter the whole page,
  graphs included, down to just that outcome. A **Clear filters** button
  appears whenever a filter is active, to jump back to the default view.
- A **Filter** control for kid, allowed/blocked, and a date range (1, 7,
  14, or 30 days) that applies to everything below it at once -- the
  totals, both graphs, and the activity table never disagree about what
  window they're showing.
- Two graphs (Chart.js, vendored locally -- no CDN dependency): activity
  over the selected date range, and top domains by request count.
- A **Pending approval requests** card at the top, independent of whatever
  filter is set, listing anything a kid has asked to have approved (see
  below) with **Approve**, **Approve for everyone**, and **Dismiss** for
  each.

**Kid-initiated requests:** the page a kid sees when something's blocked
now has a "Request approval" button. They don't need to know the
dashboard exists or where the Report page is -- clicking it creates a
pending request an admin sees immediately, instead of the only path being
someone noticing it later in the log.

## Quickstart

Requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) with the `docker
compose` plugin, on a native Linux host (not Docker Desktop -- see
`docs/deployment/setup.md` for why).

```
git clone https://github.com/J1nx888/parental_proxy
cd parental_proxy
./setup.sh
```

The wizard asks for your LAN CIDR, an admin username/password, whether to
expose the dashboard beyond this machine, and whether you want a friendly
block page (needs this machine's LAN IP). Then it builds and starts the
three default containers: `proxy`, `dashboard`, and `adguard`.

The network-level interception layer (ARP redirect + `nftables`, see the
intro above) is a separate, opt-in profile, deliberately not started by
`setup.sh` since it changes how traffic on the LAN is routed:

```
docker compose --profile interception up -d
```

It refuses to start without `ARP_WORKER_IFACE`/`GATEWAY_IP`/`GATEWAY_MAC`
set in `.env` -- no defaults, on purpose. See
[`docs/deployment/setup.md`](docs/deployment/setup.md) for the full
variable reference.

## Setting up a person

**As of 2026-08-30, there is no device proxy configuration and no
per-person proxy password anymore** -- Squid runs in native intercept mode
and resolves identity from the device itself (see RoadMap.md's Squid
intercept-mode section). The username/password created below is for
domain/show assignment only; it currently has no login of its own to use
anywhere (reserved for the future Phase 4 captive portal).

1. **Dashboard → Users → Add user.** Pick a username and password for this
   person (the password isn't checked by anything yet -- see above).
2. **For any device that needs SSL-Bump refinement** (e.g. Crunchyroll):
   **Dashboard → Devices → Add device**, enter its MAC address, assign it
   to this person, and check "SSL-Bump enabled." Then, on that device,
   install the CA certificate (Users page has a download link -- same
   certificate for every device, no per-device cert). That's the only
   manual step on the device itself; no proxy address, port, or
   credential to set anywhere. (A device that only needs DNS-tier
   protection, not SSL-Bump, doesn't need this step at all once Phase 3's
   captive portal exists -- see RoadMap.md's Phase 4 section; today, every
   device still needs a manual `Devices` entry since that portal isn't
   built yet.)
3. **Approve shows/sites** ahead of time (from their user page / the
   Domains page), reactively from the Report page as blocks show up, or
   let the kid ask -- the block page has its own "Request approval"
   button that surfaces a pending request on the Report page without
   anyone needing to go looking for it. Approving works even for a site
   that was never configured before -- it gets created automatically,
   either scoped to that one user or, via "Approve for everyone," to the
   whole household.

Setting `DASHBOARD_URL` in `.env` gets you a real, project-branded block
page. Without it, a blocked `bump`-mode or redirect-mode `splice` attempt
still gets Squid's own generic "Access Denied" page rather than nothing --
`DASHBOARD_URL` is a nicer version of that, not a requirement for it to
work at all.

Per-device CA-certificate-trust steps (Windows/macOS/iOS/Android/Chromebook)
are the same as v1 -- see the "Setting up a device" walkthrough in that
project's history if you need the exact menus; trusting one CA cert is now
the *only* mechanism, with no proxy setting to pair it with.

**Native apps:** same caveat as v1 -- this filters the *website*. A native
app doing certificate pinning will fail to connect rather than being
filtered, since SSL bump can't get around pinning without modifying the
app itself (which this project doesn't do). Check the app's own
parental-control features or your OS's app-blocking controls if the app
matters to you.

## What's genuinely new vs. v1, and what carried over

**Carried over:** the SSL-bump approach itself, the Crunchyroll CMS
resolution logic (`cr_api.py` is untouched), the show-approval-by-pasting-
a-URL flow, the defense-in-depth idea of a path allowlist independent of
the show-level check, the CA-cert-download-from-the-dashboard onboarding
flow.

**New:** per-user permissions against a `users` table (originally
identified via Squid Basic Auth per person; since 2026-08-30, identity
instead comes from the client's device -- see the intro above --
permissions themselves are unchanged), SQLite instead of JSON/text files,
one unified decision engine instead of split static-file + script logic,
the mode system (splice/bump/trusted) making the "decrypt everything or
nothing" choice explicit and per-domain instead of an implicit
whole-project default, the access log + reporting UI, click-to-approve,
live-editable settings (LAN CIDR, admin credentials) instead of baked
into `squid.conf` at container start, and -- newer still -- DNS-tier
ad-blocking (AdGuard Home) and a network-level interception layer
designed around no per-device setup at all (opt-in, not yet run on a
real household LAN -- see the intro above), both absent from v1 entirely.

**Behavior change worth knowing:** v1 was already default-deny (a fixed
final `deny all` in squid.conf) -- v2 doesn't change that philosophy, it
just makes the allowlist per-person instead of shared. What *does* change
is how much traffic gets decrypted: v1 mostly spliced non-Crunchyroll
domains (never inspected them), and only fully decrypted Crunchyroll
itself. v2 defaults new domains to `splice` too (same low-decryption
posture), but reporting and per-path rules on any *other* domain now
require deliberately switching that domain to `bump` mode -- that's a
choice you make per-domain, not a blanket change.

```

**The one datastore is one SQLite file** (`/config/parental_proxy.db`, WAL
mode) on a shared Docker volume -- every container that touches it opens
it directly, no other IPC between the Python side and the Go side. There's
no caching layer to go stale: `ttl=0` on every `external_acl_type` line
means Squid re-checks with the helper on every new connection, and
`nftables-manager` polls the same DB on its own interval rather than being
told when to reconcile.

## Testing notes

This sandbox has no Docker daemon, so `docker compose up --build` itself
hasn't been run. What *has* been tested is a real, runnable suite under
[`tests/`](tests/README.md) (`pip install pytest && pytest`, no Docker or
network needed -- see that file for what's covered):

- Both Squid helper scripts (`sni_helper.py` in all four modes,
  `authz_helper.py`), including the shared stdin/stdout protocol loop
  itself -- correct per-user domain/show decisions, correct LAN/identity
  fail-closed behavior, correct access logging with dedupe. (As of
  2026-08-30, identity is resolved from the client's device rather than a
  per-request login -- see RoadMap.md's Squid intercept-mode section;
  `basic_auth_helper.py` was removed along with the login it supported.)
- The full dashboard workflow via Flask's test client: admin auth, user
  CRUD, domain CRUD, per-user domain assignment, the CSRF/cross-origin
  guard, and -- specifically -- the click-to-approve flow for both a
  blocked site and a blocked show (including "Approve for everyone"),
  confirmed to actually grant access afterward (not just show a success
  message).
- The full kid-initiated request lifecycle: `/blocked`'s "Request
  approval" button through to an admin's Approve / Approve for everyone /
  Dismiss, including that Dismiss clears the request without granting
  anything. The Report page's kid/status/date-range filtering (applied
  consistently to the stat strip, both graphs, and the activity table),
  the clickable Allowed/Blocked stat links, and Clear filters.
- `seed_defaults.py` idempotency (run twice, no duplicates/errors), plus a
  regression case for the `crunchyrollcdn.com` mode bug and confirmation
  that `crunchyrollsvc.com` -- confirmed dev-only in Crunchyroll's own
  production config, and removed from the codebase -- is never seeded.
- `common/matching.py` domain-suffix anchoring (including the substring/
  suffix bypass cases), path matching, and the LAN CIDR check.
- `common/cr_urls.py` request classification and `common/auth.py` password
  hashing, including malformed/tampered-input edge cases.
- `common/cr_api.py` (token refresh/retry-on-401/error handling) and
  `common/series_resolve.py`'s cache (positive/negative TTL, and the S2.6
  stale-on-error fallback -- writing this test caught a real bug where the
  stale entry was being deleted before the fallback could serve it; now
  fixed, see `docs/review-2026-08-28.md`).

Separately (not part of the `pytest` suite, just a manual syntax check):
Squid config template, Dockerfiles, docker-compose.yml, and both shell
scripts for syntax validity.

**Update (2026-08-28): all of this has now actually been run**, against a
disposable Debian 12 VM with Docker, and separately on a real Android
tablet -- `docker compose up --build`, real proxy auth, real per-site and
per-show enforcement, CA trust, and real Crunchyroll playback (one show
approved and playing, a second, unapproved show correctly blocked). Five
real bugs were found and fixed in the process (Debian's plain `squid`
package lacking SSL-Bump support, a missing directory needed for cert
generation, a Squid protocol quirk that silently broke every
`external_acl_type` decision, an `http_access` ordering bug that bypassed
per-show enforcement entirely, and a wrong assumption about Basic-auth
percent-encoding) -- see `docs/review-2026-08-28.md` for the full writeup
of each. The Squid `external_acl_type`/`ssl_bump`/Basic-Auth combination
this project depends on is confirmed working as designed.

**This section is a historical snapshot, not the current authoritative
status** -- a lot has shipped and been live-verified since, including the
whole `adguard`/`controller`/`phase3` stack above, running together as
Docker containers against a disposable test VM (native intercept mode,
AdGuard integration, the ARP/nftables interception layer end-to-end, and
several real fault-injection tests: an ungraceful container crash, a
sustained OOM-kill). See
[`docs/testing/overview.md`](docs/testing/overview.md) for the current
test-suite reference (what runs where, current test count) and
[RoadMap.md](RoadMap.md) for what's been verified live vs. what still
needs a real household LAN or real hardware.

## Backing up / moving to another machine

Same idea as v1, different filename:

```
docker run --rm -v <project-dir-name>_pp_config:/config -v "$PWD":/backup \
  alpine tar czf /backup/pp-config-backup.tar.gz -C /config .
```

This includes the CA private key (so devices don't need to re-trust a new
cert after a restore) and the full SQLite database (every user, permission,
and log entry).
