# Ad/tracker blocking, layered on top of AdGuard's own default filter --

# registers and enables "AdGuard DNS filter" with real rules moments
# after configuring (checking the raw AdGuardHome.yaml file too early
# makes it look empty; the live /control/filtering/status API is the
# one that's actually accurate). These additional lists are pulled from
# uBlockOrigin/uAssets, at the user's own request -- but NOT the whole
# repo blindly: uBO's lists are written for a browser extension
# (cosmetic element-hiding, JS scriptlet injection) that a DNS server
# fundamentally cannot apply -- only each list's DOMAIN-blocking subset
# is usable here. Every URL below was confirmed live to parse with a
# meaningful nonzero count of exactly that subset (not picked from the
# repo's file listing blindly): filters.txt (uBO's main list, ~6k usable
# domain rules despite being mostly cosmetic), badware.txt, privacy.txt,
# resource-abuse.txt. unbreak.txt is included specifically to counteract
# the others' false positives (uAssets ships it as the matching
# exception list for exactly this purpose) -- never subscribe to one of
# these without its companion exceptions list. Explicitly left out:
# annoyances*.txt (cookie-banner/cosmetic-heavy, low DNS-blocking value,
# real over-blocking risk), experimental.txt (opt-in even within uBO
# itself), the per-year filters-20XX.txt archives and ubol-filters.txt/
# lan-block.txt/ubo-link-shorteners.txt (niche, not obviously a sane

# Same reasoning as dashboard/dashboard.py's DASHBOARD_BIND default:
# with `network_mode: host` (required for DNS interception, see
# docker-compose.yml's own comment), the wildcard bind above would put
# AdGuard Home's own admin UI -- a second login surface this project
# didn't build, separate from our dashboard -- directly on the LAN. If
# a non-wildcard bind was actually requested, rewrite the now-written
# config's http.address directly and restart onto it: AdGuardHome.yaml
# only takes effect while the process isn't running (AdGuard's own
# documented behavior), which this restart satisfies, and there's no
# more self-conflict once the wildcard listener above is torn down
# first. Set ADGUARD_WEB_BIND=0.0.0.0 to skip this step and deliberately
# expose it on the LAN instead.
