// Conflict records that an IP was requested in more than one policy
// set at once -- ambiguous input the caller (controller) should log
// and treat as a bug in its own desired-state computation, not
// something to silently paper over without a trace.
type Conflict struct {
	IP       string
	Sets     []SetName // every set that requested this IP, in priority order
	Resolved SetName   // which set it was actually kept in
}

// ResolveConflicts returns a DesiredPolicy where every IP appears in at
// most one of the four mutually-exclusive sets (AllSetNames), keeping
// each conflicting IP only in its highest-priority set (AllSetNames
// order: bypass > authenticated > unauthenticated > quarantine,
// matching the design skeleton's prerouting chain evaluation order --
// bypass short-circuits via `return` before anything else is checked,
// so an IP that's also listed in quarantine but belongs in bypass must
// never be dropped), plus the list of conflicts found so the caller
// can log them. An empty conflict list means the input was already
// well-formed.
//
// desired.Bump is resolved separately and is NOT part of the four-way
// exclusivity above -- it composes with Authenticated rather than
// competing with it (see SetBump's doc comment). Its only precondition
// is RoadMap.md's hard-deny invariant: a bump-enabled device must also
// BE an authenticated one, since bump-tier is a refinement of
// authenticated access, not a standalone class. A bump IP that didn't
// resolve into Authenticated above (e.g. a device flagged bump_enabled
// while also ignored or quarantined -- a bug in the caller's own
// desired-state computation, not something that should happen) is
// dropped here rather than trusted blindly, with a Conflict recorded
// (Resolved left as the zero value, meaning "member of no set") so it
// isn't silently swallowed.
//
// Output ordering is deterministic (sorted by IP) so callers -- and
// this package's own tests -- can compare results without needing an
// order-insensitive comparison.
